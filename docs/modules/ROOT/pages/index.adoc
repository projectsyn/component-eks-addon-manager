= eks-addon-manager

eks-addon-manager is a Commodore component to manage EKS addons.

EKS "addons" are components which are deployed when a cluster is initially installed (kube-proxy, CoreDNS, and the AWS VPC CNI) but which aren't upgraded automatically when the EKS control plane is upgraded.

This component requires the [resource-locker-operator component] to manage the addon versions.

The component requires that the Lieutenant object of the cluster has a fact `eks_version` which is set to the current EKS version of the cluster.

This fact can be set on a cluster object with

[source,bash]
----
kubectl -n lieutenant patch cluster c-cluster --type=merge -p '{"spec":{"facts":{"eks_version": "1.19"}}}'
----

See the xref:references/parameters.adoc[parameters] reference for further details.
